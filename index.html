        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jovany Cardenas Vargas, and I am <span id="age"></span> years old. I come from a family of 
            two younger brothers and two older half-brothers. My parents are from Mexico and work in the strawberry fields. 
            I was born and raised in Santa Maria, CA, and developed an interest in Computer Science during high school, 
            starting with a Web Design class that sparked my passion for coding.</p>
        
        <p>I graduated from Pioneer Valley High School in 2022 with a 3.6 GPA and continued my education at Allan Hancock 
            College, where I am pursuing an Associate's in Science for Computer Science. My coursework includes CS111 (Fundamentals of Programming 1),
            CS112 (Fundamentals of Programming 2), CS131 (Computer Organization), and I am currently taking CS161 (Discrete Structures).
            I plan to transfer to a four-year university like CalPoly SLO to further my education and get my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I am involved in various extracurricular activities, including SkillsUSA, 
            the Computer Science Club, the Science and Engineering Club, and support programs like EOPS, CAN-TRIO, and MESA. 
            I have achieved significant success in SkillsUSA, winning gold at the state level for two years and silver at the 
            national level. I am competing again this year and have already won gold at the state level.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to being a full-time student, I work at the Career Center at Allan Hancock College as a student worker, 
            assisting students with job searches, resume creation, typing tests, and meeting with career counselors. 
            I also help organize events like Career Expo and Career Carnival, and support various programs within the 
            Career Center, including SkillsUSA and College Corps.</p>
