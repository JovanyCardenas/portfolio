            <p>I come from a family of 2 younger brothers and 2 older half brothers. My parents come from Mexico and they
            both work in the Strawberry fields. I was born and raised in Santa Maria, CA and I got interested in Computer Science
            in high school, I started with a Web Design class which got me interested in coding.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="student-life">
            <p>I graduated from Pioneer Valley High School in 2022 with a 3.6 GPA and went to Allan Hancock College to continue
            my education. At Allan Hancock College, I decided to study Computer Science and I have been completing my coursework
            like my general education and major specific coursework, for my major I have done the CS111, CS112, CS131 and I am taking CS161.
            I am also planning to transfer to a 4-year university like CalPoly SLO or another good school where I can learn and improve myself further.

        <div class="extracurricular-activities">
            <p>Outside of school, I also am a part of SkillsUSA, the Computer Science Club, Science and Engineering Club, and other support programs
            like EOPS, CAN-TRIO, & MESA. SkillsUSA is a program that I participated to compete in Computer Programming which I competed for 2022-23 and
            won Gold at State Competitions, as well as winning Silver at Nationals, I was also the Secretary for SkillsUSA. I am also competing in SkillsUSA
            for 2023-24 year and I have won Gold at State again and am going to compete in National Competitions. I signed up to this program to challenge myself
            and to keep myself learning and improving. as well as to keep coding and practicing.</p>

        <div class="work-life">
            <p>Other than being a full-time student, I also work at the Career Center at Allan Hancock College, I am a student worker and I help students seek jobs,
            create resumes, take typing tests, meet with career counselors, helping with different events that we host such as Career Expo or Career Carnival, and much
            more. I also help programs that run within the Career Center such as SkillsUSA, College Corps, and help with other tasks from other programs that may need some
            help. I am currently working with the College Corps team and helping the staff with doing many different tasks like making phone calls to all our fellows, sending
            out emails to instructors to spread information on what is College Corps, assisting with events and event preparation, and many more tasks that would be needed.</p>
