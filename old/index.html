        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jovany Cardenas Vargas, and I am <span id="age"></span> years old. I come from a
            family with two younger brothers and two older half-brothers. My parents, originally from Mexico,
            work in the strawberry fields, and their work ethic has been a source of inspiration for me. I was
            born and raised in Santa Maria, CA, and first discovered my passion for Computer Science in high school
            through a Web Design class that opened my eyes to the creative and logical possibilities of coding.</p>

        <p>I graduated from Pioneer Valley High School in 2022 with a 3.6 GPA and am currently pursuing an Associate of
            Science in Computer Science at Allan Hancock College. My coursework includes key foundational classes such
            as CS111 (Fundamentals of Programming 1), CS112 (Fundamentals of Programming 2), CS131 (Computer Organization),
            and CS161 (Discrete Structures). I plan to transfer to a four-year university like Cal Poly San Luis Obispo to
            earn a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and continue exploring software development, AI, cybersecurity,
            information technology, and system design.</p>

        <p>Outside of academics, I actively participate in clubs and enrichment programs such as SkillsUSA, the Computer
            Science Club, and the Science and Engineering Club. I also benefit from support programs like EOPS, CAN-TRIO,
            and MESA, which have helped me grow both personally and professionally. Through SkillsUSA, I’ve had the
            opportunity to compete and lead at a high level—earning gold medals at the state level three years in a row
            and a silver medal nationally. I plan to remain active in the organization for all four years that I am at Allan Hancock College,
            I have served as the Chapter Secretary, Chapter Vice-President, and currently as Chapter President.</p>

        <p>Professionally, I work at the Allan Hancock College <a href="#career-center-student-worker-id" style="text-decoration: none;color:#650202">Career Center</a> as a student worker, where I support
            students with job searches, resume and cover letter writing, and preparation for meetings with career
            counselors. I also help facilitate events like the Career Expo and Career Carnival, and provide operational
            support to programs like College Corps and SkillsUSA. In Fall 2024, I stepped in as a Substitute Career
            Center Program Specialist, where I took on more advanced responsibilities, including coordinating with
            community partners, managing logistics, and assisting with onboarding and fellow support.</p>

        <p>All of the programs below were developed as part of the SkillsUSA Computer Programming competitions I’ve participated in. Each competition presents challenges without any prior notice, requiring competitors to design and build functional programs entirely from scratch. At the state and national levels, we typically have around two hours to complete each task, and are usually given at least two distinct programming prompts. Below is a selection of projects I’ve created during these timed competitions.</p>
